# 80i08: Quantum Self-Evolving AI Image Generator

**80i08** is an experimental, self-evolving AI pipeline built around ComfyUI. It integrates autonomous self-improvement, LLM-driven prompt engineering, quantum-inspired code analysis, and knowledge ingestion from your personal book collection.

## Architecture

- **ComfyUI Submodule:** The backbone for all image generation.
- **Custom Nodes:** Extend ComfyUI with LLM prompt refinement, quantum code parsing, feedback, caching, and book ingestion.
- **Books Integration:** Place your books (TXT or Markdown) in the `books/` folder for fine-tuning and agent knowledge.
- **Automation:** GitHub Actions, webhooks, and local scripts keep code/data synced and evolving.
